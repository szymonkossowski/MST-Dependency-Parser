# Dependency Parser based on Minimum Spanning Trees
Adaptation of the final project done for the Data Structures and Algorithms for Computational Linguistics III class in Winter Semester 2023/24 at the University of Tübingen. The task was to debug MST parser and write better scorer class. Initial code was provided by the lecturer Çağrı Çöltekin ([@coltekin](github.com/coltekin)) and the tutors: Darja Jepifanova ([@ydarja](github.com/ydarja)) and Giulio Cusenza ([@GiulioCusenza](github.com/GiulioCusenza)).

The code was debugged and extended by Nikita L. Beklemishev ([@lilovyjgrib](github.com/lilovyjgrib)) and Szymon T. Kossowski ([@szymonkossowski](github.com/szymonkossowski)).
